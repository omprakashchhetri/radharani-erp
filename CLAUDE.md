# Radharani Jewellery ERP

Internal stock-audit ERP + read-only ecommerce catalog for Radharani Jewellery Works. The core problem is tamper-evident tracking of physical stock (vault, counter, karigars, hallmarking, customers) — this is not primarily an online store.

Full reasoning behind every schema decision: @docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
Exact columns/relationships for all tables + ER diagrams: @docs/SCHEMA_REFERENCE.md
UI design tokens, layout shell, shared components: @docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
Confirmed client requirements this build is based on: @docs/REQUIREMENTS.md

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Never `UPDATE` or `DELETE` a `movements`, `sales`, or `purchases` row — corrections are new rows referencing the original, approved by an owner. The narrow exceptions, matching the schema's own design: `sales.confirmed_by_accountant`, `sales.invoice_number` (the placeholder `RESV-...` number is replaced with the original Tally bill number an admin types in, both set together at the same verification moment), and a movement's `approved_by` column may be set once, by an admin, as part of the verification/review flows described below — nothing else on those rows ever changes.
2. Never store a calculated price, except `sale_items.price_at_sale` (a deliberate snapshot at time of sale).
3. Every write needs a real `user_id` — no anonymous or shared-login actions.
4. Photos go through `PhotoCompressionService` — never save an upload directly.
5. New slow/async work goes through the queue (`database` driver) — never the request cycle.
6. New modules convert their matching wireframe in `resources/views/wireframes/` where one exists — several newer modules (Exchange, Refinery, Orders, Notifications, Referral, Installments) have no matching wireframe (they emerged after the original 13 were approved) and instead follow `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
7. Staff (`users`) and customers (`customers`) are two entirely separate auth systems (different guards) — never merge them. Staff log in with email **or phone** (`users.phone`); customers log in with phone only.
8. A full-page Livewire component's Blade view must **never** wrap itself in `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>`. Set the layout from PHP instead: `return view('livewire.x.y', [...])->layout('components.layouts.app', ['title' => '...']);`. See "The Livewire double-layout trap" below — getting this wrong silently breaks every button/form on the page.
9. Items returning from karigar or hallmarking sit in `items.status = 'pending_review'` until an admin confirms them via the Pending Review queue (`movement.approve` permission) — never write them straight back to `in_stock`.
10. A sale is not final until an admin verifies it. On entry, sold items get `items.status = 'reserved'`, not `'sold'`; the Sale Verification Queue is what flips them to `'sold'`, sets `sales.confirmed_by_accountant`, and records the Tally bill number (see rule 1). A sale with a balance can still be verified.

## Stack

- Laravel 13 (PHP 8.4), Blade + Livewire — no separate frontend framework, no API layer
- Tailwind CSS (the "Aurum" design system, see `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`) — Alpine.js is provided by Livewire itself (`@livewireStyles`/`@livewireScripts` in the shared layouts); `resources/js/app.js` must **not** import/start its own copy of Alpine — see the trap below.
- MySQL 8+, database-driven queue (no Redis), local disk storage with WebP-compressed photos (no S3)
- Hosting: Hostinger shared plan — SSH + cron + phpMyAdmin only, no VPS, 20GB storage
- Auth: Laravel Breeze (blade stack); `spatie/laravel-permission`, `spatie/laravel-activitylog`, `intervention/image`
- Designed to swap infra later via config only (`local`→`s3`, `database`→`redis` queue) — never a rebuild

## Stock module conventions

- **Regrouping is history.** `Item`, `Packet` and `Box` log changes via `spatie/laravel-activitylog` (log name `stock`); `StockHistoryService` merges those with `movements`, sales and QR scans into the Item/Packet/Box Detail timelines. So always move things with a per-model `->update(['packet_id' => ...])` / `->update(['box_id' => ...])`. A mass `Item::whereIn(...)->update(...)` bypasses model events and silently drops the move from history.
- **QR stickers** (`QrCode`) encode `route('stock.qr.resolve', $code)`; resolving logs a `scanned` activity and redirects to the detail page. `QrCode::forTarget()` reuses an existing code rather than minting a second one. SVGs are rendered by `chillerlan/php-qrcode` (no GD needed); print sheets are at `stock.qr.print?ids=...`.
- **Scanner input** goes through `App\Support\StockLookup`, which accepts HUIDs, internal codes, packet/box codes, sticker codes and full scan URLs.
- **The shop has no handheld scanners; phones scan with the camera.** Every field that takes a code gets a camera button: `<x-ui.scan-button target="#id" …>` or `<x-ui.search-input scan>`. Both open the one shared scanner in `components/layouts/partials/scanner.blade.php` (`html5-qrcode`, lazy-loaded via `window.rjLoadScanner` in `resources/js/app.js`), which fills the field as if it were typed. The top-bar Scan button opens any scanned code via `stock.scan`. The camera only works over **HTTPS** (or localhost). Spreadsheets (CSV/XLSX) go through `App\Support\SpreadsheetReader` (`openspout/openspout`).
- **The Add/Edit Item form** is its own component (`Stock\ItemForm`), opened with `Livewire.dispatch('open-item-form', { id })` / `{ purchaseItemId }` and emitting `item-saved`. Don't duplicate it into other pages; embed `<livewire:stock.item-form />`.
- **List pages** use `App\Livewire\Concerns\WithDataTable` with `<x-ui.datatable>` (see `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`).

## Raw material ledger (11 October meeting)

- **`raw_metal_entries` is append-only** and only `App\Services\RawMaterialLedger` writes to it (`receive`, `release`, `transfer`). A move between holders is two rows sharing a `transfer_id`; a holder can never go negative (`InsufficientRawMaterial`). Never edit a row; correct with an opposite row.
- Each row has a `holder_type` (`shop`, `karigar` with the vendor id, `refinery` with the batch id) and a `kind` (`refined`, `old_gold`, `scrap`). Advances and metal payments draw from **shop + refined** only; old metal is refined through the refinery or reclassified by a manager (`rawmaterial.manage`).
- A measured purity becomes a carat label through `RawMetalEntry::caratFor()` (91.6 is 22K); anything that does not fit keeps its own figure ("76.2%"). Always store carats through `RawMetalEntry::normalizeCarat()`.
- Posting happens at: purchase (+ shop), exchange settle (+ shop, old metal, net weight), refinery send (shop to refinery, chosen from stock) and return (refinery to shop refined, loss visible), karigar advance (shop to karigar), karigar payment (out of shop), karigar receipt (uses up what that batch's karigar still holds).
- Tests for movements need the MySQL dev database (the migrations use MySQL-only statements): `DB_CONNECTION=mysql DB_DATABASE=radharani_erp php artisan test --filter=...`. They roll back inside transactions.

## Exchange credit (11 October meeting)

- The value of a settled exchange (`final_value`) is **credit** until spent. `exchange_applications` is insert-only (kind sale/order/cash, amount; a cancelled order returns its credit as a negative row). Credit left = `ExchangeTransaction::creditRemaining()`. Always apply through `App\Services\ExchangeCredit::apply()`, which locks the exchange row so one value can never be spent twice.
- A sale pays with it as a `sale_payments` row of mode `exchange` (with `exchange_transaction_id`); that mode is never picked from the dropdown. An order's advance records the exchange part; the order page shows it.
- **Livewire trap:** old-style accessors (`getTotalProperty`, `$this->total`) are cached for the rest of the request. Code that reads a figure and then changes what it is built from (payments, cart) must call the getter method directly (`$this->getTotalProperty()`), or the rendered page shows a stale figure.

## Carats and customers (11 October meeting)

- **`RateLog::CARATS` is the only list of carats** (gold now includes 9K). `ItemForm::PURITIES` is built from it; add a carat there and nowhere else, then add its fineness in `ExchangeDeductionPreset::FINENESS` and a deduction preset row.
- **One add-customer form for use inside another flow:** `Customers\CustomerForm` (modal), opened with `Livewire.dispatch('open-customer-form', { name, status })`; it saves or finds the customer and announces `customer-saved` ({ id }), which the host page listens for (`#[On('customer-saved')]`). Used by New Sale, New Order and New Exchange. Don't copy it inline. The Administration > Customers page keeps its own full form.
- **GSTIN** is optional, kept upper case through `Customer::setGstinAttribute`, and checked everywhere with `App\Rules\Gstin` (15 characters, fixed pattern). It prints on the bill and the invoice view when set.

## GST, price breakup and pricing by weight (11 October meeting)

- **GST is a choice on the bill.** Two rates: on the jewellery (metal, making, stones, extra charges, less the adjustment) and on the hallmarking charge. The owner's defaults (3% and 18%) live in `tax_settings` (Pricing rules > GST); a sale chooses its own on the Items step (0 is an option). A sale keeps `gst_jewellery_percent`, `gst_hallmark_percent`, `gst_amount` and `gst_hallmark_amount`, and `sales.total` **includes GST**. `sale_items.price_at_sale` is the price before GST. All the sums are in `PricingService` (`gstOnItem`, `gstOnBill`, `breakupLines`); screens never compute GST themselves.
- **GST shows everywhere a price does:** the Items step breakup, the bill and invoice, the item page, the price simulator and the public website (`StorefrontCatalog`, with GST at the owner's defaults).
- **Pricing rules are set by weight band** (`weight_range`, grams, net weight when known, bottom included and top excluded). New price-range rules can't be made; older ones keep working and are flagged on the page.
- **Cheque** is a payment mode; its number and bank go in the payment note.

## Conventions added with the 8 October change list

- **Batches are identified by date and time.** Karigar issues (`karigar_raw_batches`), hallmark dispatches (`hallmark_batches`), imports (`entry_batches`) and raw-material purchases show `label` (`j M Y, g:i a`). Part receipts (`karigar_receipts`, `hallmark_receipts`) are insert-only; the owner or manager closes what has not come back, with a note.
- **Categories are a tree**: `item_categories` (metal, then subcategory); `items.category` is kept as the subcategory's name and `items.category_id` links it. `Item::saving` links name-only code paths to the tree.
- **Locations** are owner-managed (`locations`); `movements.location_id` records where a `vault_out` went and a second `vault_out` to another place is a place change. `Location::isInVault()` is the vault check Sales uses. Old `vault_out` rows with no location read as the first counter (movements are never edited).
- **Pricing**: `RateLog::latestFor($metal, $carat)` is the rate for a carat; `PricingRule` rows (making, additional, discount, hallmark) are matched most-specific-first (product, category, price range, metal, all); the price range is measured on the metal value only. A making value set on the piece itself is its own product-level setting.
- **Money is only in Sales and the price simulator.** Karigar and hallmarker ledgers are weights and counts only; the dashboard shows no money.
- **Soft deletes** on boxes, packets and items. Deleting is blocked for a sold or out-of-store piece and for a non-empty container.
- **Front-end build**: `public/build` is tracked. Run `npm run build` after adding Blade views or Tailwind classes or the new classes will not exist in the browser.
- **PDF downloads** use `dompdf/dompdf`; Excel downloads use `openspout`.
- Livewire reads a dot in a `wire:model` key as a path, so inputs keyed by a carat such as `99.9` use `DailyRateEntry::key()`.

## Public website (storefront) conventions

- **`/` is the public website**, not a login chooser. The staff/customer chooser lives at `/sign-in` (linked from the site footer); `/login` and `/portal/login` are unchanged.
- **It is deliberately outside the ERP's front-end stack.** `resources/views/storefront/*` use their own layout with the site's own CSS/JS in `public/storefront/` (plain files, cache-busted by `App\Support\StorefrontAsset`, not Vite) and a self-hosted GSAP 3.15 bundle (core + ScrollTrigger, ScrollSmoother, SplitText, ScrollToPlugin). No Tailwind, Livewire or Alpine on those pages, and no Aurum tokens: the storefront keeps the `rr-web-ui` design pixel-for-pixel. Plain controllers (`StorefrontController`), not Livewire.
- **Data flows one way:** `App\Services\StorefrontCatalog` builds `window.RJ_DATA` (pieces, categories, collections, today's rates, shop details, URLs) and the scripts render from it. Prices arrive already computed (`PricingService`, no GST); the browser never calculates a price.
- **One listing = one physical piece.** A piece shows only when `show_on_website` is ticked, it has a `web_name`, its subcategory in the category tree is switched on, and `status = 'in_stock'`, so reserved/dispatched/sold pieces drop off by themselves. `slug` and `listed_at` are set once on first publish (`Item::booted()`), never regenerated.
- **Staff manage it** under Website in the sidebar (`website.manage`, owner + manager). Website fields on the Add/Edit Item form are only shown to, and saved for, that permission. Catalogue photos are `item_images` rows via `PhotoCompressionService` (not `movements.photo_path`).
- `php artisan db:seed --class=StorefrontDemoSeeder` (local/testing only; also run by `DemoDataSeeder`) loads the design's sample catalogue from `database/seeders/data/storefront-demo.json`, using Unsplash URLs for images.

## The Livewire double-layout trap (read before touching any full-page component)

Every full-page Livewire component (anything bound directly to a route, e.g. `Route::get('/x', SomeComponent::class)`) gets auto-wrapped by Livewire in a layout on **every** request if it doesn't call `->layout()` itself — including AJAX responses for `wire:click`/`wire:submit`. If the component's own Blade view *also* wraps its content in `<x-layouts.app>` (a full `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` document), every interactive action returns an entire second HTML document as the morph payload, which breaks the page (it goes blank) after literally any button click. This exact bug shipped for a while — every full-page component was self-wrapping and had zero working interactions beyond the initial page load.

**The fix, and the only correct pattern going forward:**
- Blade view: no `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>` wrapper — just the inner `<div>...</div>`.
- PHP class: `render()` ends with `->layout('components.layouts.app', ['title' => '...'])` (or `components.layouts.guest` for guest pages; the Customer Portal components use `components.layouts.portal`).

Plain **non-Livewire** pages (a regular Controller returning `view(...)`, e.g. `auth/login.blade.php`, `welcome.blade.php`) are the one place `<x-layouts.app>`/`<x-layouts.guest>` self-wrapping is still correct — there's no Livewire auto-layout involved for those.

## Alpine.js trap

Livewire v3 bundles its own copy of Alpine and unconditionally sets `window.Alpine` when its script runs. If `resources/js/app.js` *also* `import`s and starts a separate `alpinejs` package copy, you get two competing Alpine instances ("Detected multiple instances of Alpine running" in the console) and `x-data` elements stop reacting to `wire:model` correctly. `resources/js/app.js` must stay Alpine-free. Every page still gets Alpine via `@livewireStyles`/`@livewireScripts`, which are included directly in `components/layouts/app.blade.php` and `components/layouts/guest.blade.php` (safe to include even on pages with no actual Livewire component — Livewire won't double-inject if a real component is also present).

## Environment setup traps (easy to reintroduce on a fresh clone)

1. `bootstrap/app.php` needs Spatie's middleware aliases manually added (Laravel 11+ removed `Kernel.php`) — already applied there; reapply if it goes missing.
2. `config/auth.php` needs the `customer` guard/provider/passwords block — see `config/auth-additions.md`.
3. `composer require laravel/breeze` alone does nothing — must also run `php artisan breeze:install blade`.
4. Portal Livewire components must use `->layout('components.layouts.portal')` (the public website's shell, fed `RJ_DATA` by a view composer in `AppServiceProvider`), never Breeze's default — that default assumes a staff login and crashes on any guest/customer page. Redirect between portal pages with a full page load (`$this->redirect(...)`, not `navigate: true`) so the site's header and scripts boot fresh. `bootstrap/app.php` sends signed-out `portal/*` requests to `portal.login` (and signed-in customers to `portal.dashboard`), everything else to the staff login.
5. The `jobs`/`job_batches`/`failed_jobs` tables aren't part of any business migration — easy to forget, breaks the queue silently until first dispatch.
6. `public/storage` must be a symlink to `storage/app/public` on **this machine** (`php artisan storage:link`) — it silently breaks (points at a stale path) if the project directory is ever moved or cloned somewhere new.
7. Time is **IST everywhere**: `config/app.php` timezone defaults to `Asia/Kolkata` (`APP_TIMEZONE`) and the MySQL session is set to `+05:30` (`DB_TIMEZONE`) so `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` defaults agree. Don't reintroduce `'UTC'`. Rows written before 25 Sep 2026 were stored as UTC and display 5h30m early; they were deliberately not rewritten because `movements`/`sales`/`purchases` are insert-only.
8. After a fresh clone/migrate, run `php artisan db:seed --class=DemoDataSeeder` (local/testing environments only — it's gated out of anything else) to get realistic test data across every module instead of empty screens.
